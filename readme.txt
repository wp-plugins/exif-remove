== Description ==

after it is uploaded, all Exif data will be removed from the image.
There is no original image left, nor made a backup.
This plugin uses the removal service of http://www.exif-remove.de .

As of now, to prevent abuse, the eventually existing

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I check whether this plugin is installed correctly or not? =

This Plugin is working transparently within your WordPress blog.
There should be a settings menu called "Exif-Remove" where you are able
to (de)activate the plugin. The upload dialogs (in articles/pages) will
not be modified by this plugin, so you won't see any difference.
