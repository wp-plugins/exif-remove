This Plugin is working transparently within your WordPress blog.
There should be a settings menu called "Exif-Remove" where you are able
to (de)activate the plugin. The upload dialogs (in articles/pages) will
not be modified by this plugin, so you won't see any difference.
You may also check your images with http://www.exif-viewer.de/ .
